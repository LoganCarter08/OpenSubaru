##Notes

This model came from an unidentified aftermarket short throw shifter from a USDM 2002 WRX. This appears to be what is called a "narrow" shifter as the 
bushing housing is too narrow for the shifter linkage and this wide bushing is used to fill the gap. The terminology may be incorrect here, so please let 
me know if I have this incorrect. 

The following part number seems to be for the wide version while this is the narrow version. Have not identified the correct OEM part number. 
OEM part number: 35035AC000 (bushing) and 35045AC040 (sleeve)
