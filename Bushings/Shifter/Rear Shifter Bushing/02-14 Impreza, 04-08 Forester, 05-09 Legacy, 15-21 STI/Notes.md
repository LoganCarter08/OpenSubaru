##Notes

This model came from an aftermarket piece. Unsure of the exact brand (I believe it was a generic one on eBay), but it worked great in my 2002 WRX. 

This may fit other models than what are listed, but could cause the shifter to sit higher or lower. i.e. this fit in my 1999 Impreza 2.5RS with no issues at all with both the 5 and 6 speed.
