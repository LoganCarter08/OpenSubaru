# OpenSubaru

This is a project to store any information for Subarus that may not be easy to acquire with a quick Google. One day his repo may 
include anything from 3D models for bushings, open source diff controllers, or simple DIY guides. 

## Reasoning:

As these cars get older and fewer we may start to see the reduction of available parts from Subaru or aftermarket 
companies. Having as much information recorded and documented can help keep the cars alive in the hands of DIY'ers. There 
are also a handful of people who would prefer to spend $20 on a $10 part for the sake of DIY. 

We are seeing a great movement away from the forums that once housed tons of useful information and with that many of 
these forums are shutting down and their great wealth of information is lost. Storing that outside of the heads of a few people 
is very important to our community. 

Use the contents of this repo in any way you desire. There will be no license on anything found in here. Want to fix your car? Go for it. 
Want to start a business and sell physical versions of models in this repo? Do it.  

## Contribution:

If you would like to contribute to this repo in any way please reach out to me and let me know. I would love to include old and 
unique models too. Looking at you SVX owners.
